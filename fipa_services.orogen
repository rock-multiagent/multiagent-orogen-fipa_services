# The FIPA message bus relies on the application of so called MTS's
# (Message Transport Services) - mainly to allow
# for inter-robot communication.
# 
# An MTS allows to register 
# receivers and will write the information to the receivers 
# according to the receivers named in the FIPA message
#
# Warning: components should be started with
# the '--sd-domain' option to allow for autoconnection behavior
