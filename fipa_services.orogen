version '0.2'
# Switched to orogen for all modules. Because of that the
# namespace name of every module has to be unique. So, the namespace
# name will describe the module, the class name will always be 'Module'.
version '0.3'
# Revised role of root element. Changed to message transport service only
version '0.4'
# Moving to fipa_services

# The FIPA message bus relies on the application of so called MTS's
# (Message Transport Services) - mainly to allow
# for inter-robot communication.
# 
# An MTS allows to register 
# receivers and will write the information to the receivers 
# according to the receivers named in the FIPA message
#
# Warning: components should be not be started with
# the '--sd-domain' option
#
# By default the distributed service directory can be
# monitored with the following commands:
#    - service_discovery-browse _fipa_service_discovery._udp
#    - avahi-browse _fipa_service_discovery._udp
