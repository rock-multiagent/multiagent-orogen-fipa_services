    /*! \class MessageTransportTask
     * \brief The task context provides and requires services. It uses an ExecutionEngine to perform its functions.
     * Essential interfaces are operations, data flow ports and properties. These interfaces have been defined using the oroGen specification.
     * In order to modify the interfaces you should (re)use oroGen and rely on the associated workflow.
     * The FIPA message bus relies on the application of so called MTS's
     *  (Message Transport Services) - mainly to allow
     *  for inter-robot communication.
     *  
     *  One MTS per robot/environment is responsible for delivering message
     *  to a set of components, here identified by an environment id as part
     *  which is part of the components name: <env-id>_<type>.
     *  
     *  An MTS will be recognized by its type suffix: <env-id>_MTA, where
     *  the <env-id> follows <robot-type>_<id> (thus the second underscore
     *  separates <env-id> and <type>, e.g. crex_0_MTA)
     *  
     *  An MTS allows to register
     *  receivers and will write the information to the receivers
     *  according to the receivers named in the FIPA message
     *  
     *  Warning: root modules and derived components should *NOT* be started with
     *  the '--sd-domain' option. Instead the property 'avahi_type' should be used,
     *  to set domain and type (_udp,_tcp).
     *  Otherwise a runtime condition exists between receiving events from the
     *  underlying service_discovery and registering callbacks for these events.
     *  !! -- this requires to be fixed in upcoming versions -- !!
     * \details
     * The name of a TaskContext is primarily defined via:
     \verbatim
     deployment 'deployment_name'
         task('custom_task_name','fipa_services::MessageTransportTask')
     end
     \endverbatim
     *  It can be dynamically adapted when the deployment is called with a prefix argument.
