    /*! \class MessageTransportTask
     * \brief The task context provides and requires services. It uses an ExecutionEngine to perform its functions.
     * Essential interfaces are operations, data flow ports and properties. These interfaces have been defined using the oroGen specification.
     * In order to modify the interfaces you should (re)use oroGen and rely on the associated workflow.
     *
     * This oroGen task represents a message transport task
     * to allow to allow for inter-robot communication in a p2p communication network.
     *
     * Typically this instance will be controlled from the ruby layer (refer to bindings)
     *
     * Calling the operation 'addReceiver' will trigger the creation of an output port of a predefined name, e.g. 'agent_0'
     *
     * The client can then connect to this output port and any message addressed to 
     * 'agent_0' will be delivered to this port.
     * This agent name
     *
     * \beginverbatim
         #include <fipa_acl/fipa_acl.h>

         fipa::acl::ACLMessage message;
         message.setPerformative(AclMessage::REQUEST);
         ...
         fipa::acl::Letter letter(message, representation::BITEFFICIENT);
         fipa::SerializedLetter serializedLetter(letter, representation::BITEFFICIENT);
     * \endverbatim
     *
     *
     * \details
     * The name of a TaskContext is primarily defined via:
     \verbatim
     deployment 'deployment_name'
         task('custom_task_name','fipa_services::MessageTransportTask')
     end
     \endverbatim
     *  It can be dynamically adapted when the deployment is called with a prefix argument.
